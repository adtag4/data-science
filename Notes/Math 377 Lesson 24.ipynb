Those of you who have taken statistics before may recognize this value as $\\alpha$. \n",

The probability of a Type II error is harder to find and requires a more in-depth analysis of a hypothesis test. The probability of a Type II error is often given as $\\beta$, and $1-\\beta$ is referred to as **Power**. The power of a test is probability that we will reject the null hypothesis when we are supposed to. \n",
